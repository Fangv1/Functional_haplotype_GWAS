# data for the code of SNP_FH_GWAS.r

### phenotypic data (FT10_phenotype.txt)

phenotypic data is a matrix (1004 rows and 2 column). 
the first column is the name of genotype and second column is the phenotypic value 
the first row is 'Genotype' and 'Phenotype'

Genotype	Phenotype
10001	68.75
10002	61
10004	81.75

### genotypic data (genodata.txt)
the first column is the genotype and second column is the genetic value (0 for the first homozygote, 1 for heterozygote, 2 for another homozygote)


### Rogers' ditance (RD) matrix ('all_chr_1003_RD' used for caculating the kinship, kinship= 1 - RD )
