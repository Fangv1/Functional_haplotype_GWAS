# Functional haplotype GWAS
Selecting closely-linked SNPs based on local epistatic effects for haplotype construction improves power of association mapping

### phenotypic data (FT10_phenotype.txt)
the first column is the genotype and second column is the phenotypic value
the first row is 'Genotype	Phenotype'

### genotypic data (genodata.txt)
the first column is the genotype and second column is the genetic value (0 for the first homozygote, 1 for heterozygote, 2 for another homozygote)
